## cocos2d python platformer experiment

I was trying to load a tiled map and do collision with it, also experiment with scenes and transitions.  

In order to install cocos2d, you can type

	pip install cocos2d

or navigate to the root of the project and install whatever's listed in 'req.txt'.

	pip install -r req.txt
